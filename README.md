## Description
This is a basic version of a student's manangement system. This means it is an app to do some basic CRUD and storage functionalities mainly for students. The application's frontend is done using React and its server side done using Sinatra (and Ruby).

## What works?
A user can:
> View students, instructors, courses tables

> Sign up as a new student

An admin can:
> Do all the things a user can do

> Edit a student's information

> Delete a student's information

## What doesn't work?
> User authentication

 ## Installation
Ensure you have npm installed on your computer.

 > Fork this repository and clone it to your computer.

 > In the folder where you've cloned it, cd into the cloned project

 > If your terminal wasn't open before this, open it and run the commands below:

 ```
    npm install
    npm start
 ```

 This process will enable you to have your the project in your local environment but the link above (deployed link) should function similarly to running npm start.

 This process will enable you to have your the project in your local environment but the link(s) above (deployed link) should run automatically without any installations.

## Future implementations
> A user should be able to visit the app but be able to only see his/her own information. This towers on user authentication.
